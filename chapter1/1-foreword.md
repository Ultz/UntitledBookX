This book will be using C++, but as loosely as possible to allow readers looking to use Vulkan in other languages to easily translate the snippets within this book. To this end, we have excluded typical C++ boilerplate such as headers, which you'll need to provide yourself. In any case, the full C++ source is available in our GitHub repository. We recommend having an intermediate understanding of how C++ works before continuing.

If you're reading this in one of the finished copies we distribute, thank you so much for supporting us! If you're just reading this on GitHub, then please consider supporting the authors of this book by buying an official copy. Reading through the content is a lot easier in book/e-book form, and we only charge a small price - cheaper than most other Vulkan books available in fact.
