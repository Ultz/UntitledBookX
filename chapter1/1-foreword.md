This book will be using C++, but as loosely as possible to allow readers looking to use Vulkan in other languages to easily translate the snippets within this book. To this end, we have excluded typical C++ boilerplate such as headers, which you'll need to provide yourself. In any case, the full C++ source is available in our GitHub repository. We recommend having an intermediate understanding of how C++ works before continuing.
