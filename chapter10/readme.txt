Chapter 10 - Textures

The primary author of this chapter is undetermined. It will teach you about:

- Introduction to "textures" (images)
- Introduction to resources
- Uniforms
- Expanding on descriptor sets (we'd have only briefly gone over descriptor sets before I'd imagine)
- Introduction to samplers
- Anisotropy
- Staging
- Creating an image
- Creating an image view
- Creating a sampler
- Maybe a textured quad like the end of chapter 8?
