# Vectors

In mathematics, a vector is a list of elements. A single element on its own is known as a scalar. A vector is basically a one-dimensional array of elements.

With GLM, you can create a vector as follows:

```c++
vec4 vec(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
```

Vectors can be of any size, but in graphics programming, only vectors of lengths 2 to 4 are commonly used, so those are the only ones included in GLM.

Mathematic notation for vectors is as follows:
