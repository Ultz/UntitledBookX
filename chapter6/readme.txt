Chatper 6 - Pipelines

The primary author of this chapter is undetermined. It will teach you about:

- Introduction to graphics pipelines
- How all of this links into Vulkan
- Vertex input & input assembly (set it up to use buffers, we'll go over buffers in the next chapter)
- Viewport state
- Rasterizer state
- Multisample state
- Configuring depth and stencil tests (no need to explain the theory, we went over it a few chapters ago)
- Blending
- Dynamic states (no need to explain the theory just yet, just configure the viewport and line width to be dynamic)
- Pipeline layouts
